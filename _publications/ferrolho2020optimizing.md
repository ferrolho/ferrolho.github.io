## Abstract

This paper focuses on robustness to disturbance forces and uncertain payloads.
We present a novel formulation to optimize the robustness of dynamic trajectories.
A straightforward transcription of this formulation into a nonlinear programming problem is not tractable for state-of-the-art solvers,
but it is possible to overcome this complication by exploiting the structure induced by the kinematics of the robot.
The non-trivial transcription proposed allows trajectory optimization frameworks to converge to highly robust dynamic solutions.
We demonstrate the results of our approach using a quadruped robot equipped with a manipulator.
