[Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

I will keep this short and simple.

I used to have a *somewhat-technical* blog hosted at [https://difusal.blogspot.co.uk/](https://difusal.blogspot.co.uk/).

I have decided to revive my lost blogging activity here — since I prefer [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) — and now.
