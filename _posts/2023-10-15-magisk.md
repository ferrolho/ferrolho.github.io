## Redmi Note 12 Pro (ruby)

To flash a new update, make sure you are in FASTBOOT mode, not in FASTBOOTD — notice the 'D' at the end.

Then, flash with
```
./flash_all_except_storage.sh
```

Download the ROM from https://miuirom.org/phones/redmi-note-12-pro#EEA

```
unzip miui_RUBYEEAGlobal_V14.0.6.0.TMOEUXM_3e0d2680a7_13.0.zip -d ~/miui
```

Download this:
https://github.com/tobyxdd/android-ota-payload-extractor

> [!NOTE]
> If your Mac computer uses Apple silicon, download the `android-ota-extractor-v1.1-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`.

To extract only the `boot.img` from the *Recovery ROM's* `payload.bin`, run
```
./android-ota-extractor ~/miui/payload.bin boot
```

The boot image can be directly extracted from the ROM's ZIP with:
```
./android-ota-extractor miui_RUBYEEAGlobal_OS1.0.3.0.UMOEUXM_bd54bd38dc_14.0.zip boot
```

> [!NOTE]
> If on a macOS, you may need to right-click the executable, select `Open`, and then the `Open` button.

Push it to your Downloads folder:
```
adb push ~/Downloads/boot.img /sdcard/Download/
```

Now, using your phone:
1. Open the Magisk app
2. Press Install (the 1st one, not the 2nd one)
3. Check the 'Select and Patch a File'
4. Choose the `boot.img` in your Downloads folder

Now, back to your laptop, pull the modified `boot.img` with
```
adb pull /sdcard/Download/magisk_patched-26300_rWIiJ.img
```

Reboot into fastboot mode
```
adb reboot bootloader
```

Flash the patched `boot.img` with
```
fastboot flash boot ~/Downloads/magisk_patched-26300_rWIiJ.img
```

Finally, reboot with
```
fastboot reboot
```

And that should be all!
