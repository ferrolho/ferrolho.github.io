Low-cost airlines never cease to amaze me. I was trying to change the date of my outbound flight and Ryanair's website was not allowing me to do so. As a result, I tried to get some assitance using their 'Live Chat'. However, the conversation was a bit... well, just have a read.

# Part 1: Welcome to Ryanair Live Chat

Support Agent: *Muhammad Z*

— **Muhammad Z.**
Hi Henrique Ferrolho, my name is Muhammad Z, welcome to Ryanair Customer Support. I would be happy to help you with your query. Please stay connected while I review your query and reservation details.

Hello! I am trying to change a flight but I cant get the website to press the 'continue' button after selecting the new flight.

OK, let's investigate this further. Can you tell me what type of internet browser (Google Chroms, Internet Explorer, Firefox etc.) and device (laptop, iPhone, Android, Mac, iPad etc.) you are using. A useful site to check this: http://bit.ly/2wvebmU

— **Henrique Ferrolho.**
I tried both on Chrome, Firefox on my computer.
Also tried on my phone with Chrome and Ryanair app.... The app does not even list the change flight option

— **Muhammad Z.**
​Unfortunately our new website is based on Google Chrome we can not guarantee that it works fine with other browsers, eg. Safari. If you could download Google Chrome it will be working I am sure about this.

Please delete your browsing history and cookies, then restart the browser and try again. It is essential to restart the browser or at least refresh the Ryanair page.

— **Henrique Ferrolho.**
I am using Chrome! I tried deleting cookies, restarting browser: it doesn't work... The 'Continue' button is greyed out even after selection of the new flight

— **Muhammad Z.**
Could you please try in Incognito mode? Please press Ctrl+Shift+N keys at the same time while using Google Chrome and use the new window that will appear to access your booking.

— **Henrique Ferrolho.**
Does not work either

— **Muhammad Z.**
Please use only google chrom not the firefox

— **Henrique Ferrolho.**
i am mainly using chrome.... i said already

— **Henrique Ferrolho.**
hello?

— **Muhammad Z.**
Can you try it again after few minutes?

— **Muhammad Z.**
I don't mean to rush you, but I haven’t heard back from you in more than 2 minutes and I’m wondering if you're still connected. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

— **Muhammad Z.**
Thank you for using our Live Chat Service. Goodbye.

*Muhammad Z has closed the chat.*

## Part 2: Facebook Messenger

Since I had gone nowhere with this, I gave their Facebook Messenger account a try (<a href="m.me/ryanair">m.me/ryanair</a>). I actually ended up speaking with **two different assistants in the same chat**, with the signatures *AG* and *MM*. Here is how it went:

I have tried on Google Chrome, Firefox, clearing cookies, going in Incognito mode, different devices (laptop and phone), Ryanair Android App.... Nothing seems to work. The 'Continue' button is always greyed out...
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-white">
Hi, so it will cost 24.18 GBP to process this change? Are you happy to proceed. AG

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-blue">
Thank you very much! I believe this has now been changed correctly. However, it seems that I have lost lost my priority and cabin bag?
</p>

<p class="fb-me-blue">
could you please check whether I have the 'Priority & 2 Cabin Bags' for both fly out and fly back?
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-white">
Hi, no sorry for the inconvenience but only one 10 kg bag is allowed per passenger on board (priority) or checked in. MM
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-blue">
I don't understand your answer.... Can you please confirm that I have 'Priority & 2 Cabin Bags' for both fly out and fly back?
</p><p class="fb-me-blue">
I bought priority for both out and return flights because I want to take a 10 kg bag with me
</p><p class="fb-me-blue">
And I want to make sure that after the fly out date change I still have this
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-white">
Hi, yes for your return flight you do have priority. MM
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-blue">
I am asking concerning the fly out!
</p><p class="fb-me-blue">
Edinburgh -> Porto
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-white">
Hi, under your booking you only have priority for the return flight. MM
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-blue">
Please, can you stop for a minute and read what I am writing?<br>
<br>
I had a return trip scheduled: a fly out from Edinburgh>Porto; and a return flight Porto>Edinburgh.
I had purchased 'Priority & 2 Cabin Bags' for both of these flights.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, I just changed the date of the fly out Edinburgh>Porto with your colleague that signed the messages as 'AG'.<br>
AFTER this date change for the flight out Edinburgh>Porto, it seems that I have lost the 'Priority & 2 Cabin Bags'!
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-white">
Hi, we have looked at the flight and it appears it is sold out on the out bound, we can add a check in bag for free instead? AG
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-blue">
Hello again AG, thanks for coming back. What do you mean sold out? The 'Priority & 2 Cabin Bags' option is sold out?
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-white">
Hi, priority has sold out for that flight as there is only 100 per flight. We can add check in baggage instead for you and you will still have it for the return? AG
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-blue">
Alright, that sounds reasonable. Thank you very much!
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-white">
Hi, we have done that for you. AG
</p></div>

<div class="_1t_p clearfix"><p class="fb-me-blue">
I have just received an email confirming this:<br>
<br>
● Flight out:   FR1234  10kg Check-in Bag<br>
● Flight back:  FR2345  Priority & 2 Cabin Bags<br>
<br>
Thank you very much AG for your help!
</p></div>

And that is it... :joy:

I actually have to thank *AG*, who was truly helpful; *AG*, whoever you are, if you ever read this, **thank you so much!**
