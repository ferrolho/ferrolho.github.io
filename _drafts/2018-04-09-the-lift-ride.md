Something quite interesting, and perhaps a bit unfortunate, just happened to me at my workplace.
And this goes to prove that despite so much technological advancement, we still lack so much in one of the most profound ways of interacting with other human beings: *speech*.

---

I was waiting with a woman for the lift at the 1st floor of the building where I work at.
In the interest of the readers' understanding, I should add that I had never met this person before; I don't even know whether she works in the same building or not; maybe she was just visiting for a meeting.

The lift arrived and we both got in. She got in first but did not press any button.

— **Lady.** Are you going up?

— **Me.** Yes.

I pressed the 5th-floor button.
The lady pressed the 0th button, the ground floor.

— **Me.** Oh, sorry... I thought you were also going up.

At this point, my mind had already wondered why she was taking the lift from the 1st floor to the ground floor when she could just take the set of stairs next to the elevator shaft.
I, therefore, assumed the most likely outcome was that she had a problem or a disability stopping her from taking the stairs.

The reason why I apologised was that, since I had pressed the button first, I assumed the lift would make all the way up to the 5th floor, before dropping the lady at the ground floor.

— **Lady.** No, I am just heading out (the building).

The lift started to move. To my relief, it started the journey downwards, to make a stop on the ground floor before heading all the way up to the topmost floor of the building.

— **Me.** Oh, okay. It is a longer way up to the 5th, so...

And this is where the problem arose.
I was just trying to be polite, trying to verbalize my more elaborate thought: '*Oh, thank god we are going down first. I did not want to make you wait for the lift to make the longer journey when it could just drop you at the ground floor first.*'

— **Lady.** Well, not everyone is capable of taking the stairs.

My poor choice of words for verbalizing my thoughts gave room for the other person to think: '*How rude this young man is... Already making assumptions just because the lift is making a small detour to the ground floor before dropping him at the 5th floor.*'

At this point, I had not revised the whole dialogue exchange in my head.
I thought she was just stating her condition, confirming my initial guess from when we were starting the journey.
And as such, whilst the lift had arrived at the ground floor and the doors were opening, I replied:

— **Me.** Yeah. Have a good day!

After I did revise the situation in my head, it is clear that the person did not get a clear message of what I was trying to verbalize.
Her understanding was very different, and she was trying to be polite, even though I was not being polite if you were to solely consider my phrasing.

This just goes to prove that even in the most ordinary daily scenarios, *speech* is a very rudimentary form of transmitting our thoughts, which gives room for quite some misunderstandings.
It is not surprising that there are so many disagreements in other so much more important matters in society, some having an impact on so many people across the world...
I wonder how many political disagreements have been created from a poor choice of words from people who actually had a good intention all along.
